These single-service deployable architectures can be used on their own to streamline and automate service deployments through an [IaC approach](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-understanding-projects), or assembled together into a broader [automated IaC stack](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-config-stack) to automate the deployment of an end-to-end solution architecture.",
